# FIZZBUZZ

Description: First attempt at writing an Elixir project. The FizzBuzz app returns "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 15, "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, and "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, otherwise it will just return the number.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fizzbuzz` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do

```
